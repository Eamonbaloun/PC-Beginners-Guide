If you looking to build a gaming PC in late 2020 please don&#39;t just go, ask your tech friend or family member &quot;can you build me a gaming pc.&quot; (this offends me because part of getting a gaming pc is that it is not plug and play like a console if you want easy get a console the ps5 and xbox series x are powerhouses with minimal setup) So please clear you schedule because this will take some time.

I love computers I have been an enthusiast for over 10 years and have built and setup many computers. I want to help people get into this hobby that I have come to love so much. That is why I am going make a guide for new people getting into PC gaming.

- _Disclaimer there will be a lot of overlap in most of videos that was done on purpose I didn&#39;t get everything on my first time learning about them._
- _Also make sure that you check when the video was made. all the videos I have linked are 100% accurate and the only thing I would say is if it from 2019 there have been new CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s so not everything has up to date info but are still good videos none the less._

1. Picking Parts

Now that you have some sort of an idea of what you need to build a pc lets choose some parts

_As of September 2020 new graphics cars have come out and if you can find them in stock the 3070 is faster than the 2080ti and the 3080 is a 4k 60 fps beast and is above any of the 20 series cards_

1. Building

This step is not as hard as it seems I would only start building when you have all the parts. The main YouTuber I would recommend for building computers is[careyholzman](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareyHolzman). He is the best at showing what goes where and explaining why he does things the way he does. Below are some of his build videos please watch at least one from start to finish on your own before you build the pc. Then watch the video again as a step by step guide when putting it together.

- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfbEcDff2Z0)
- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-j9ILxpsCA)
- I will also include some tip videos from other Youtubers that are helpful to know before you build.

1. Windows

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for.

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)
- [FREE programs that EVERY PC should have...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRbMfZKuRUo)
- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&amp;t=457s) this guide will slightly cut into windows functionality I would recommend skipping from 11:50 to 17:50 skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store.

- If you are looking to play a specific game and want the best settings than look for a guide by [Panjno](https://www.youtube.com/user/PanjnoTutorials)
  - [Call of duty Warzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU8S3srYtbg)
  - [Rainbow six siege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5psNE7nGCg)
  - [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFnl2dZfQo)
  - [Apex Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdqvkbDP4Dc)
  - [GPU overclock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1dGwFOdFLI&amp;t=646s)
  - [Nvidia settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZrnfWpENTo&amp;t=464s)
  - [AMD settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1N4vV5BSoI)
  - [WIFI settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAke9R-k3so&amp;t=181s)
- If you are looking for the best performance and fully tweaked pc then you want to look at the youtuber[FR33THY](https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth) and his A-Z series for settings up windows. This will make windows light for gaming but will cut into the functionality of windows a lot. So only do what you feel is best for you and your needs.
