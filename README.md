If you want to build a gaming PC, this guide will serve as your one-stop shop for gaming computers. I&#39;m writing this guide so that people don&#39;t just go to a tech friend or family member and ask, &quot;Can you build me a gaming PC?&quot; (This bothers me because part of getting a gaming PC is that it is not plug and play like a console; if you want easy, get a console; the PS5 and Xbox Series X are powerhouses with minimal setup.) So, if you were sent this guide, please clear your schedule because this will take some time. It&#39;s also fine to go back and watch the videos again if necessary. If you have the time, I recommend watching as many videos as you can because it improves the experience when the computer you built is 100 percent yours and you know everything about it.

I love computers. I&#39;ve been a computer enthusiast for over ten years and have built and configured numerous computers. I want to help others get into this hobby that I have grown to adore. That is why I am going to write a guide for newcomers to PC gaming.

Videos labeled as optional provide additional information that may be useful but do not apply to everyone and can be skipped; however, for the best results, I recommend watching as many as you can.

- _Disclaimer there will be a lot of overlap in most of videos that was done on purpose I did not understand everything at first._
- _All the videos I have linked are 100% accurate and I would stick with people I have liked not everyone on YouTube gives the right information. The only other thing I would say is if it from 2019 there have been new CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s so not everything has up to date hardware, but the information and concepts are still good none the less._

1. Picking Parts

Now that you have an idea of what you&#39;ll need to build a PC, it&#39;s time to pick some parts. ([Refer to this video if you need a quick refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imxVMrp9hdg))

- First what I would do before choosing parts is find out what resolution and refresh rate you will be trying to game at. ([Refer to this video on what that all means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50c82iC0PU))
  - [How to correctly choose parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DcWgxMZ3k)

  - [How to Make Sure All Your Computer Hardware Parts Are Compatible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfjm7fSLWE) - PCI gen 4 is out since this video was made B450 and x570 motherboards support it on AMD no intel boards support it, Intel now supports PCIE gen 4 but only with their 11th series CPU&#39;s.

- Used PC&#39;s Parts
  - I wasn&#39;t sure where to put this, but I thought it was important enough to mention. As a result, I&#39;m going to create a category for it. So, my opinion on used computer parts is that unless you know the person personally, it can be a risky purchase. I believe that most of the time, people are unaware of the value of what they are selling and can rip you off.
  - [Don&#39;t get RIPPED OFF!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOTZyhxO_yk&amp;t=28s)
  - The best Person to watch before buying using PC&#39;s is Greg Salazar and his [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyReHG5dDxXX3ENYj2zUP9TU5FfSWijoi) on people selling computers on places like Facebook and Craigslist. Please educate yourself before purchasing a computer from someone you don&#39;t know.

- PC Advice – _Please don&#39;t skip this part, it is the most important step._
  - [Byte Size Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdkpbFQAQFLK_DeO10PpVNg)has some excellent suggestions for selecting parts I strongly advise you to watch these videos because they are brief and to the point about what is the best value for money. I understand that he may say things that others would disagree with, but he has been in the tech industry for over 20 years and knows far more about PCs than most people. He focuses on value for money and what will last you the longest for your money.

If you intend to use your gaming PC for something other than gaming, such as your job, and you work with Adobe software or engineering software like CAD or SolidWorks, I recommend 32 gigs as a minimum. (It may appear to be expensive, but if you follow the pc hardware deals, I linked below, you can get kits of ram for a low price; do not be deterred by the price.)

  - [The Perfect Gaming PC Parts In 2021!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cg-MNGuYWY&amp;t=102s)
  - So, in terms of which CPU and graphics card to buy, the TLDR advise I can give is to buy whatever you can afford... These two components will be the most expensive parts of your build, I find that a good starting point is make sure you are getting an 8 or more core CPU. As, for GPUs I like Nvidia&#39;s 70-series cards, such as the 3070, but if you want to go any higher, the 80-series cards are excellent 4K capable GPUs.

  - [GPU and CPU Pairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AihX9OjqnYc) This video will show the best CPU and GPU combinations to avoid bottlenecking. This video is getting old, but the idea of pairing a Ryzen 5 3600 with an RTX 2060 is still a good one. Just in your head insert updated hardware, so instead of a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, Replace it with the new Ryzen 5600x CPU and an RTX 3060 GPU, and so on....

- PC Cases
  - When looking for a case, I always go to Gamers Nexus because they have the best reviews and are not afraid to say something negative even if they were sent the case for review. [PC cases playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OupiPZybyBE&amp;list=PLsuVSmND84QtrMP_niRTD2zIa3uUhxIvn)-|-[Best PC Cases of 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffuAnwGivO8)here is a round up from Gamers Nexus of the best cases in 2021.

- [The BEST PC Cases For Your Gaming PC Build 2021!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6vlOVwV49k)

  - Also, this video is another good one to look at if you are on a budget [The Best Budget Cases for your Gaming PC! ($40-$70)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYYq1QXts_Y&amp;t=28s)

  - Last thing about of PC cases Just because a case has appealing lighting doesn&#39;t mean you should go out of your way to get it. High airflow is the most important feature to look for in a case. Don&#39;t be fooled by flashy lighting; there are plenty of cases on the market with lighting that don&#39;t sacrifice airflow. Also, just because one of your favorite streamers employs a particular case does not imply that it is a good case. I know that [Nadeshot&#39;s cash app compound facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7tLhqWB2Q&amp;t=315s) for esports and streamers uses NZXT cases for every pc in the building; these aren&#39;t bad cases, but just because they do doesn&#39;t mean you have to. (The best advice I can give is to simply do your research.)

- 2020 Part lists!

One thing to keep in mind is that if you go with a low-cost build ($700 or less), you may end up spending more money later on when you upgrade because you want to play the latest games and you bought a 6 core chip or only 16 gigs of ram because it was &quot;recommended,&quot; but the minimum and recommended specs for all games will rise, and it may be better to buy the higher-end part to avoid in the future having to replace parts due to the PC getting slow.

Please visit PC Part Picker, which is a fantastic website for parting out your build. You can also send the list to friends and on forms to see what their thoughts are on your build. Also, this website checks to ensure that all of your parts are compatible, so you don&#39;t have to worry about whether something fits perfectly because the website checks it for you automatically.

  - [The Herd Mentality PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mODI4-cRhPE&amp;t=405s) - the case is a little unconventional, but this build has some of the best parts you can buy right now on new egg. (all the parts come with warranties included with some parts having up to a 6-year warranty)
  - [My STUNNING ITX RTX 3070 Gaming PC Build 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3jx5LpgcZg&amp;t=28s) – this is really good small build I really like the case.

- I would also check out Reddit they have many threads on deals for pc hardware my favorite is [r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/hot/) it is worth checking out because someone is always posting a deal I would filter by hot or new to get most popular and legit deals.

2.5 Prebuilt - (Optional)

- I really want people who are looking for a prebuilt PC to understand exactly what they are getting into, and if you are looking for a prebuilt PC, please watch these videos because it is very easy to spend a lot of money on these systems and not get anything worthwhile in return.

- [Warnings About Pre-Built PCs: Proprietary Parts, Monthly Charges, &amp; Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxBogvUe_c&amp;t=340s)

- [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw) They did a series called Secret Shopper in which they went undercover and bought prebuilt computers to review; it&#39;s a really good series for understanding what makes a good prebuilt. [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7WMF4wWko) -|- [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2kCUbY4ZWs&amp;t=439s) -|- [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ViO0ETvfEc&amp;t=15s) -|- [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go5tLO6ipxw&amp;t=1157s)

- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA) has been working on a series to find a prebuilt gaming computer that a person who knows nothing about computers can turn on and start playing games. [NZXT BLD Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY-SEPGvqxY&amp;t=831s) -|- [Cyberpower $1000 Pre-Built Gaming PC Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68aE1za_Ak&amp;t=268s) -|- [iBUYPOWER Pre-Built Gaming PC Slate MR1004 Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sDRiakWcIM&amp;t=1280s) -|- [Dell G5 5000 PC&#39;s Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMg6hUudHE) -|- [110°C VRAM Dell GTX 1660 Super Video Card Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaJZq13tr8&amp;t=193s)ß This video is a review of a graphics card included with a Dell prebuilt computer.

- Here is a collection of videos that will be useful if you are looking for a prebuilt computer.

- [Pre-Built Gaming PCs Are Getting Desperate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxsdasEC2cM&amp;t=354s)

- Good Prebuilds

  - New Egg is one of the largest online retailers in the United States for anything PC-related, and they have their own brand of PC called ABS, which is made from off-the-shelf parts and is reasonably priced. Dawid Does Tech recently reviewed [this ABS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APy_TyQSpPI) and found it to be adequate for the price. It ran a little hot due to the all-glass front panel, but he made a [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZhIpX97v0) for $50 to address the temperature issues. After adding some fans and replacing the CPU cooler this prebuilt can run E-sports games (Warzone, Apex legends, Fortnite, overwatch, League of Legends, ect…) over 60fps.

  - A good option for pre-built computers is if you have a Micro Center near you that is really good way to get help with your first PC. They offer pre-built computers from parts you pick out. [This video is review of the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&amp;t=245s)

1. Building

This step is not as difficult as it seems, but I would wait till you have all the parts before starting to build. [Carey Holzman](https://www.youtube.com/c/CareyHolzman/videos) is by far the best YouTuber for computer building. He is the best at demonstrating where things go and explaining why he placed something where it is. Please watch at least one of his build videos from beginning to end on your own before starting to build the computer. Then, when putting it together, use the video as a step-by-step guide.

1. Optimizing Windows- \ ***Please do not skip this step it is so important\***

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for I have helped friends who bought a 144hz monitor and never went into the Nvidia control panel and swapped it from 60hz to 144hz so the entire time they had owned that monitor they were never using the 144hz that they paid for. (Also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus, it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4))

Also, for this video I would also skip disabling services with Nsudo that can cause problems down the road the overwatch A-Z video has a better way of disabling services. (skip anything about windows apps)]

- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS &amp; Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&amp;t=228s) - even if you don&#39;t play overwatch this guide is still really good it covers almost everything, I would recommend without cutting into windows functionality at all so please if you want to make windows snapper for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial this is it please watch this one.
