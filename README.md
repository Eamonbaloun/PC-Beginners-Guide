# Beginner's Guide to Building a Gaming PC

Hey! So you are new to building your own gaming computer? Don't worry, I got you! This guide was created specifically for you. Building a PC may appear daunting at first, but with the right assistance, you'll have the perfect gaming setup operational in no time. This guide focuses on mistakes I've made over the years that caused me to have to buy twice, and I want to make sure others don't have the same problem, so this guide is written from a value point of view, doing everything possible to get the most for your dollars.  

## Why Build Your Own Gaming PC?

Building your own gaming PC is a much better deal and gives you way more control. Unlike consoles, you get to pick every part yourself, letting you push graphics and performance far beyond what consoles can handle. A good PC gives you smoother frame rates, higher resolutions, and extras like ray tracing that make your games really pop. Sure, consoles share some of these features, but PCs almost always get them first. Plus, when you need more power, you can just upgrade a single part instead of replacing the whole system, which saves you money over time. And it’s not just about gaming! A gaming PC is a multitasking beast that can handle video editing, graphic design, streaming, and more. It’s the perfect solution for work and play.

### Tips for Watching the Videos

- Take your time. No need to rush.
- Rewatch any parts that feel tricky.
- Some videos are optional—they’re extra resources to dive deeper if you want. Totally up to you if you watch them, but they’re worth checking out!

## About Me

I’ve been messing around with computers for over a decade and have built quite a few. I’m here to share what I’ve learned and help you skip the mistakes I made when I was starting out.

## Disclaimer

- Videos marked with ❗ are **must-watch**—don’t skip them!
- **No single source has all the answers**, which is why I’ve included videos from different creators.
- You might notice some overlap between videos—don’t worry, repetition helps!
- Stick to trustworthy creators so you’re getting reliable info.
- Some videos might be a bit older, but the core principles still apply. So don’t stress about it!

### Parts Lists

## 🚨 Top Recommendations for Builds 🚨

**AT THE MOMENT I CAN'T RECOMMEND INTEL CPU'S 13TH AND 14TH GEN** *([Click here to find out why](https://youtu.be/gTeubeCIwRw))*

### Guide to Building a Solid PC
I wanted to make a quick guide on what I think makes a solid build. The key to a good build is smart spending. This isn’t about specific parts, but more of a general outline of what you should aim for. It’s important to invest wisely now so you don’t end up paying twice later. Skimping on parts might seem like a good idea in the short term, but you’ll likely have to upgrade sooner than expected when performance starts to lag. Paying a little more upfront ensures that your system remains relevant longer, which saves you the cost (and headache) of having to replace parts prematurely. One last thing: always research what your game or program best benefits from in terms of hardware. Different applications and games have unique demands, so knowing what components they rely on most—whether it's CPU power, GPU performance, or more RAM—will help you allocate your budget more effectively. No single source has all the answers, which is why this is a general outline and not a part for part list. 

Make sure to put together a part list on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and share it on forums. People will help you fine-tune your build—I help people with their part lists all the time on Reddit. Just be clear about what you want to do with your computer and the games or programs you plan to use.

## CPU

Go for at least 8 cores, but I recommend 12 if you can. It gives you better multitasking and smoother gaming, and spending a little more now helps make sure your CPU won’t bottleneck your GPU or slow down under heavier workloads later on. [More cores](https://youtu.be/cHV_XPOm0oY) mean better performance and longevity overall. If your main focus is gaming, AMD’s X3D chips are excellent—so for those, 8 cores like on the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is totally fine. But if you’re going with a non-X3D CPU, I’d aim for more cores since they benefit a lot from the extra threads. More cores are always better for **Intel or non-X3D chips**.

## GPU

The big question: [Nvidia or AMD?](https://youtu.be/BJ75QVCip88) Honestly, it depends on what you’re looking for. I’ve always gone with Nvidia—not because AMD is bad, but because I’ve found Nvidia’s drivers, overall stability, and features like DLSS to be totally worth the extra cost. AMD definitely gives you more raw specs for less money, though, which is great if you’re on a budget. My two cents? **12GB of VRAM is kind of the minimum these days, but 16GB is definitely preferred**—if you can spend a bit more upfront, you’ll thank yourself later when future games get more demanding. If you’re wondering which brand of GPU to buy (like MSI, ASUS, etc.), check out this helpful video: [Which Brand of GPU Should You Buy in 2024?](https://youtu.be/LBbU7yBQ9qo). Now, here’s something cool—Intel is making GPUs too! They’re the first new player in the dedicated graphics space in like 25 years, which is a big deal. Their cards are pretty decent, but as with any new tech, there are some bugs to work out. If you’re curious how they perform, this [video](https://youtu.be/bjhSDXJkwUg) covers it well. Personally, I hope Intel keeps at it—we really need more competition, because with just AMD and Nvidia, things have been a bit stale. *(Side note: if you do creative work like video editing or 3D rendering, Nvidia’s CUDA cores give a serious edge in performance and have been supported in most software for years. That first Nvidia vs AMD video touches on this too.)*

## Cooler

Cooling is an important factor in your system's performance and longevity. Whether you choose air or liquid, **Noctua** is my go-to company for CPU cooling. Purchase the most expensive **[Noctua cooler you can afford](https://noctua.at/en/products/cpu-cooler-retail/buying-guide-cpu-coolers)**. Better cooling allows your system to run faster for longer periods of time without throttling, reducing the need for frequent upgrades. I recommend **[Noctua's NH-D15 G2](https://youtu.be/0zqPICl5zjA)** or the **[ID Cooling A620 Pro SE](https://youtu.be/khiGzg8J40s)** for a more affordable cooler, but the G2 is still the best. The best AIO is the **[ARCTIC Liquid Freezer](https://youtu.be/jMeH7SJO74Q)**. I would only consider a 360 AIO because there is no reason to choose a 240/280 AIO over the NH-D15 G2. TLDR: Get a Noctua cooler, and if you really want to know what the best cooler is, **[here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeRpPJPxqZlGallbEhUdhZ9OHG1qOQuH&si=g7Ut5VVN5HAxotlR)** is a good place to start. Hardware Canucks has many cooler roundup videos that are hands down the best cooler vs cooler comparisons.

## Motherboard

Never skimp on motherboards. A solid motherboard in the $220-$350 price range will meet your needs and provide greater longevity. If you choose an AMD CPU, investing in a higher-end board can help extend the life of your system because AMD tends to support their platforms for longer. This means you can upgrade your CPU later without having to replace the motherboard.

## Storage

An **NVMe SSD** is essential for any gaming PC today, offering faster load times and smoother performance. For the best balance of speed and longevity, go with at least a **1TB drive that has a DRAM buffer**—brands like **Samsung**, **SK Hynix**, and **Crucial** are dependable choices. On a budget? Options like the [Silicon Power UD90](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/silicon-power-ud90-ssd-review) and [TeamGroup MP34](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/team-group-mp34-nvme-ssd,6181.html) give you solid performance without breaking the bank. As for **PCIe generations**, **Gen 4 SSDs** are the sweet spot right now. **Gen 5 drives** are incredibly fast on paper, but they’re expensive and offer little to no real-world benefit for gaming. This [video](https://youtu.be/gl8wXT8F3W4) explains why most gamers should stick with Gen 4 (it also has good list of ALL the SSDs used in video with amazon links in the video description.)

## RAM

For modern gaming and productivity, **32GB of RAM** is the sweet spot—it’s plenty for today’s games and everyday multitasking. If you want to **future-proof** or run heavier workloads like video editing, streaming, or virtual machines, going up to **64GB** is worth it, especially since prices have dropped. In terms of speed, **DDR5-6000** is the current “good enough” target—it offers excellent performance without the steep price premiums of higher-speed kits. Personally, I run **64GB of RAM** because I grabbed it on sale. RAM deals pop up often—especially around **Prime Day** and the **November–December holiday sales**—so it’s worth keeping an eye out. I always recommend getting a little more than the bare minimum suggested, since it pays off in the long run.

## Case

**Airflow matters more than most people think!** A well-ventilated mesh case keeps your system cool, stable, and running at its best, while poor airflow just means more heat and shorter component life. Brands like **Fractal Design**, **Lian Li**, and **Phanteks** are all great for airflow-focused builds. If you want a quieter setup, **be quiet!** cases are awesome too—they trade a bit of cooling for lower noise, which is totally worth it if you value silence. For first-time builders, the [Lian Li 207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0ZYG6j0RDM/) is a great, easy-to-build-in case at a solid price. My go-to all-rounder for 2025 is the [Fractal Meshify 3](https://youtu.be/KEXqmvj1Mls)—amazing airflow, clean design, and just super satisfying to build in. If you want to compare more options, LTT’s stream covers five of the best-selling cases: [I Built 5 PCs in 5 Different Bestselling Cases](https://youtu.be/iOC7-GPWxaU).

## PSU

A good PSU will last you through multiple builds. My go-to for finding what is a good PSU is the [PSU Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/edit?pli=1&gid=1719706335#gid=1719706335), and I always strive for **A Tier**. Don't settle for lower-rated PSUs that may fail under load and damage your components. Spending more here on a high-quality PSU, such as a **Seasonic PSU**, will last you much longer than cheaper power supplies. For wattage, I recommend a 1000W PSU. It provides consistent power delivery and allows for future upgrades, saving you money because you don't have to replace it later.

## Fans 

When choosing PC fans, I consider quality, performance, and noise. I have a couple of favorites based on your budget. If I want the best, it's [**Noctua**](https://youtu.be/mM872xWJV60) all the time. Their fans, such as the NF-A12x25 and NF-A14, are extremely quiet, provide excellent airflow, and last forever. That being said, if you don't like Noctua's colors or want RGB, I recommend **be quiet!**. Their Silent Wings, Pure Wings, and Light Wings (RGB) series look wonderful, run quietly, and provide reliable performance. If I want to stay inside a budget, **Arctic** fans like the P12 and P14 provide surprisingly effective cooling for the price. No matter what I'm building, one of these brands is typically a good fit.  

  
## Building Mindset 

I’m trying to drill this thought process in: buying cheap is expensive—this isn’t about a $5K dream build but making smart choices on your actual budget so you avoid constant upgrades. Saving $50 by grabbing a $150 motherboard instead of a $200 model might strip out USB-C, built-in Wi-Fi, extra M.2 slots, or solid VRMs—and skimping on your PSU or cooler can bite you with instability, noise, and heat you’ll pay to fix later. Those small-dollar shortcuts add up to endless part swaps, more spending, and zero fun. Invest a bit more up front in each key component—motherboard, PSU, RAM, cooler—and you’ll dodge the upgrade treadmill and enjoy a solid, future-proof PC from day one.

## Optimizing Windows

Don’t skip this step! Optimizing Windows is crucial to getting the most out of your gaming rig. Some of my friends bought 144Hz monitors but forgot to change the settings in the Nvidia control panel, leaving them stuck at 60Hz. Don’t let that happen to you!

All the guides below are legit—even if your antivirus flags them. I’ve scanned them all on [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4), so you’re good to go.

## 6. Long Term PC Maintenance

To keep your PC running smoothly for years to come, here are some simple but effective tips:

### 1. Dust It Off Regularly
Dust can mess with airflow, leading to higher temps and slower performance. Every few months, grab some compressed air and clean out your fans, filters, and case. Keeping your system dust-free helps maintain optimal cooling and performance.

### 2. Update Drivers and Firmware
It might sound tedious, but keeping your drivers and firmware up to date ensures compatibility with new hardware, software, and games. Plus, it often improves system stability and performance.

### 3. Monitor Storage Health
A sudden drive failure can be devastating if you haven’t backed up your important files. Use tools to check your storage health regularly, and make backups of anything you can’t afford to lose. External drives or cloud services work great for this.

### 4. Reapply Thermal Paste
Reapplying thermal paste every couple of years on your CPU and GPU can help keep temperatures down and performance up. Use a high-quality thermal paste for the best results. This is especially important if you notice rising temperatures over time.
