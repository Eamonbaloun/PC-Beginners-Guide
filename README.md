If you're wondering which is better value for money, I'd recommend checking out their channel.
- I would also check out [dealsource.tech](https://www.dealsource.tech/deals-1)❗ This website is updated daily with deals. They don't have as many PC hardware deals, but they do post a lot of storage deals. If you want good storage for a low price, this is the place to go. (_if you click a link and buy something it supports the people that make this website_)
- I would also check out Reddit, which has many threads on deals for PC hardware. My favorite is [r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/hot/) It's worth checking out because someone's always posting a deal. To find the most popular and legitimate deals, filter by hot or new.

- Good Prebuilds
  - New Egg is one of the largest online retailers in the United States for anything PC-related, and they have their own brand of PC called ABS, which is built with off-the-shelf parts and is reasonably priced. Dawid Does Tech recently reviewed [this ABS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APy_TyQSpPI) and found it to be adequate for the price. It ran a little hot due to the all-glass front panel, but he made a [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZhIpX97v0) for $50 to address the temperature issues. After adding some fans and replacing the CPU cooler this prebuilt can run E-sports games (Warzone, Apex legends, Fortnite, Overwatch, League of Legends, etc…) over 60fps.
  - If you have a Micro Center nearby, it is a great place to get help with your first PC. They offer pre-built computers from parts you select. [This video is a review of the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&t=245s)

## 3. Building

This step is not as difficult as it appears, but I recommend waiting until you have all of the parts before starting to build. [Carey Holzman](https://www.youtube.com/c/CareyHolzman/videos)❗ is unquestionably the best YouTuber for computer building. He is the best at demonstrating where things go and explaining why he put them where they are. Please watch at least one of his build videos from start to finish before beginning to build the computer. Then, when putting it together, follow the video step-by-step.

  - [How to build a PC (POV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MYOpFONCU&t=554s)
- Another fantastic channel to keep you entertained while waiting for all your parts to arrive is [Mr Matt Lee](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_Matt_Lee). Despite being a silent PC builder, his content boasts some of the best camera angles and quality in the community.

It's a little different in that they're correcting the problems from another build guide that made a major controversy when a large tech news website posted a video on how to build a PC. This was such a bad guide from the Verge that lawyers got involved.

## 4. Optimizing Windows

***Please do not skip this step; it is so important.***

This is the most time-consuming and important step in ensuring that you get the most value for your money. I've helped friends who bought a 144Hz monitor but never went into the Nvidia control panel to change it from 60Hz to 144Hz, so they never used the 144Hz that they paid for. (Also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus, it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4)).

**Watch as many of these videos as you can:**

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)

- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&t=457s) - this guide will slightly cut into Windows functionality. I would recommend when he talks about Windows apps skip from 11:50 to 17:50; skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store. Also, for this video, I would skip disabling services with Nsudo that can cause problems down the road; the Overwatch A-Z video has a better way of disabling services. (Skip anything about Windows apps)
- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS & Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&t=228s)❗ - even if you don't play Overwatch, this guide is still really good; it covers almost everything. I would recommend without cutting into Windows functionality at all, so please if you want to make Windows snappier for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial this is it please watch this one. (Skip anything about Windows apps)

I really think that if you were to watch every video I provided in this guide, you should be more than capable of building and/or upgrading your own computer.
