If you looking to build a gaming PC this guide will be your one stop shop for gaming computers. I am creating a guide so that people don&#39;t just go, ask your tech friend or family member &quot;can you build me a gaming pc.&quot; (this offends me because part of getting a gaming pc is that it is not plug and play like a console if you want easy get a console the ps5 and Xbox series x are powerhouses with minimal setup) So if this guide was sent to you please clear you&#39;re schedule because this will take some time. Also, it is ok to go back and watch the videos again if needed. If you can I would watch as many videos as possible because it makes the experience better when the pc you built is 100% yours and you know everything about it.

I love computers I have been an enthusiast for over 10 years and have built and setup many computers. I want to help people get into this hobby that I have come to love so much. That is why I am going make a guide for new people getting into PC gaming.

Videos marked as optional give more information that could help but do not apply to everyone and can be skipped, but for best case I would watch as many as you can.

- _Disclaimer there will be a lot of overlap in most of videos that was done on purpose I did not understand everything at first._
- _All the videos I have linked are 100% accurate and I would stick with people I have liked not everyone on YouTube gives the right information. The only other thing I would say is if it from 2019 there have been new CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s so not everything has up to date hardware, but the information and concepts are still good none the less._

1. Picking Parts

Now that you have some sort of an idea of what you need to build a PC lets choose some parts. ([Refer to this video if you need a quick refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O8kr0KlkBM))

- First what I would do before choosing parts is find out what resolution and refresh rate you will be trying to game at. ([Refer to this video on what that all means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50c82iC0PU))
  - [How to correctly choose parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DcWgxMZ3k)
  - [How to Pick PC Parts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa5j_eiPATw)
  - [it&#39;s EASY to spend too much on PC parts Here&#39;s where to save money!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdsaTRBZePw)
  - [Here&#39;s what Bottlenecking REALLY looks like!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLkV5yoCUkk)
  - [How to Make Sure All Your Computer Hardware Parts Are Compatible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfjm7fSLWE) - PCI gen 4 is out since this video was made B450 and x570 motherboards support it on AMD no intel boards support it, but it is coming for intel.

- Used PC&#39;s

I didn&#39;t really know a good spot to put this, but I thought It is important enough to touch on. So, I am going to make a category for it. So my take on used computer parts is that unless you know the person personally It can be a iffy thing to buy I think most of the time people don&#39;t know the value of what they are selling and can rip you off because your really excited about a new hobby. This is normal for people just starting out with gaming pc&#39;s.

  - [Don&#39;t get RIPPED OFF!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOTZyhxO_yk&amp;t=28s)
  - The best person to watch on YouTube for used pc is Greg Salazar and his [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyReHG5dDxXX3ENYj2zUP9TU5FfSWijoi) on people selling pc&#39;s on places on Facebook and craigslist please inform yourself before you go buy a computer from some you don&#39;t know

- PC Advice – _Please don&#39;t skip this part it is the most important step._
  - [Byte Size Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdkpbFQAQFLK_DeO10PpVNg) has some great advice on choosing parts I really recommend watching these videos because they are short and to the point about what is the best for your money. I know he might say somethings that other people would disagree with, but he has been in the tech space for 20+ years and knows way more about PC&#39;s than most people.

(it may seem expensive but if you follow the pc hardware deals, I linked below you can get kits of ram cheap do not let the price scare you)

- PC Cases
  - When looking for a case I would always check out Gamers Nexus they have the best-case reviews, and they are not afraid to say something negative even if they were sent the case for review. [PC cases playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OupiPZybyBE&amp;list=PLsuVSmND84QtrMP_niRTD2zIa3uUhxIvn)-|-[Best PC Airflow Cases of 2020 So Far: $60 Budget to $200 High-End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsMNu0gWlZw) here is a round up from Gamers Nexus of the best airflow cases in 2020

  - [Top 5 Cases of 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRRms3qqS1A)

  - Also this video is another good one to look at if you are on a budget [The Best Budget Cases for your Gaming PC! ($40-$70)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYYq1QXts_Y&amp;t=28s)

  - Last thing about PC cases just because a case has fancy lighting does not mean it is good for airflow don&#39;t be fooled by fancy lighting there are a lot of cases on the market that have lighting and still don&#39;t compromise on airflow. Also just because one of your favorite streamers uses a specific case does not it mean it&#39;s a good case I know [nadeshot&#39;s cash app compound facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7tLhqWB2Q&amp;t=315s) for esports and streamers uses NZXT cases for every pc in the building those aren&#39;t bad cases, but just because they use them doesn&#39;t mean you need to. _(Just do your research is the best advice I can give)_

- 2020 Part lists!

One thing to remember is if you go with a really budget build ($700 or less) it may cost you more money down the line when you have you upgrade because your trying to play the newest games and you bought a 6 core chip or only 16 gigs of ram because it was &quot;recommended&quot; but very soon the minimum and recommended specs for all games will go up and it may be better to buy the higher end part to future proof yourself instead of having to spend $200 on a CPU and in only 2 years found out that you need to spend another $200 to upgrade because you&#39;re not getting performance that is needed to play the game smoothly or at the settings you want to play the game at. ([This video explains it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnRjlsvJ3Y&amp;t=517s))

Please check out PC Part Picker it is a Fantastic website to part out your build and you can also send the list to friends and on forms to see what their opinions are on your build. Also, this website checks to make sure all your parts are compatible so there is no need to worry about if something fits perfectly because the website checks it for you automatically.

  - [The ULTIMATE RTX 3060 Ti Gaming PC Build 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7CVBb0W4nI&amp;t=181s) – this is a great midrange esports gaming pc for games like – Call of duty, Fortnite, Overwatch, CS-GO, Rainbow 6, and Valorant
  - [The Herd Mentality PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mODI4-cRhPE&amp;t=405s) - the case is a little unconventional, but this build has some of the best parts you can buy right now on new egg. (all the parts come with warranties included with some parts having up to a 6-year warranty)
  - [My STUNNING ITX RTX 3070 Gaming PC Build 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3jx5LpgcZg&amp;t=28s) – this is really good small build I really like the case. If you&#39;re looking for a small computer that will destroy everything you throw at it this is it. I really think this is the perfect combo of parts right now last gen Ryzen paired with the new Rtx 3000 gives one of best gaming experiences out right now. For all this power to come in a console size is just charry on top.

  - [PS5 Killer PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tJjb0g_hw&amp;t=365s)- Consoles are not PC&#39;s even if they are using AMD parts.

Active deals!!!

- [Pc hardware Deals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCss3QxegBkF8BAetIo0qXA) – This channel streams all the time some of the best deals you can currently find on the market and also is focused on what is the best value for your money I would check there channel if you have a question what is better for the money.
- I would also check out [dealsource.tech](https://www.dealsource.tech/deals-1) this websites gets updated every day with deals they don&#39;t have as many pc hardware deals but they do post a lot of storage deals if you want to get good storage for cheap this is place to look. (_if you click a link and buy something it supports the people that make this website_)
- I would also check out Reddit they have many threads on deals for pc hardware my favorite is [r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/hot/) it is worth checking out because someone is always posting a deal I would filter by hot or new to get most popular and legit deals.

2.5 Prebuilt - (Optional)

- If you don&#39;t want to build the pc yourself then I would look at [NZXT BLD](https://www.letsbld.com/) service. You can find all about the [service in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSDpawYkqAo&amp;t=75s). (Building is always cheaper and better, but if for some reason you do not want to build it yourself then this is one of the best ways to go about a prebuilt.)
- Another option for pre-built computers is if you have a Micro Center near you that is really good way to get help with your first PC. They offer pre-built computers from parts you pick out. [This video is review of the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&amp;t=245s)

1. Building

This step is not as hard as it seems I would only start building when you have all the parts. The hands down best YouTuber for building computers is [CareyHolzman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmWNCO9wSjzOz1UV8jCvIHA) the videos he puts out are so good that I am surprised that they are free to watch so please if you can consider donating to him it helps him a lot and allows him to continue to produce these outstanding videos. He is the best at showing what goes where and explaining why he does things the way he does. Below are some of his build videos please watch at least one from start to finish on your own before you build the pc. Then watch the video again as a step by step guide when putting it together.

- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfbEcDff2Z0)
- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-j9ILxpsCA)
- This build guide from Linus Tech Tips is also good I would check it out if you have difficulty with 2 other build guides. _(BTW this video is in POV, so it is easy to see what to do)_
  - [How to build a PC (POV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MYOpFONCU&amp;t=554s)
- Here is a [beginners guide to gaming PC&#39;s](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnHcRQUxuoeQM4-llcMNXTakKZcAAyB6) playlist this will be another place to check when you come across something you may not know. _(these videos are optional)_
- I will also include some tip videos from other Youtubers that are helpful to know before you build.

1. Optimizing Windows- \ ***Please do not skip this step it is so important\***

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for I have helped friends who bought a 144hz monitor and never went into the Nvidia control panel and swapped it from 60hz to 144hz so the entire time they had owned that monitor they were never using the 144hz that they paid for. (also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4))

**Watch as many of these videos as you can**

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)- Please watch this video it is important that you setup windows and turn on XMP for your ram.

- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&amp;t=457s) - this guide will slightly cut into windows functionality I would recommend skipping from 11:50 to 17:50 skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store. Also, for this video I would also skip disabling services with Nsudo that can cause problems down the road the overwatch A-Z video has a better way of disabling services. (skip anything about windows apps)

- [Windows Apps the right way to remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6OT_QcHaU) – this is how to remove windows app in the best way.

- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS &amp; Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&amp;t=228s) - even if you don&#39;t play overwatch this guide is still really good it cover almost everything I would recommend without cutting into windows functionality at all so please if you want to make windows snapper for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial then at lease watch this one. (skip anything about windows apps)

- If you are looking for the best performance and fully tweaked pc then you want to look at the youtuber[FR33THY](https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth) and his A-Z series for settings up windows. This will make windows light for gaming but will cut into the functionality of windows a lot. So only do what you feel is best for you and your needs.
