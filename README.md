# Beginner's Guide to Building a Gaming PC

Hey! So you are new to building your own gaming computer? Don't worry, I got you! This guide was created specifically for you. Building a PC may appear daunting at first, but with the right assistance, you'll have the perfect gaming setup operational in no time. This guide focuses on mistakes I've made over the years that caused me to have to buy twice, and I want to make sure others don't have the same problem, so this guide is written from a value point of view, doing everything possible to get the most for your dollars.  

## Why Build Your Own Gaming PC?

Building your own gaming PC is a much better deal and gives you way more control. Unlike consoles, you get to pick every part yourself, letting you push graphics and performance far beyond what consoles can handle. A good PC gives you smoother frame rates, higher resolutions, and extras like ray tracing that make your games really pop. Sure, consoles share some of these features, but PCs almost always get them first. Plus, when you need more power, you can just upgrade a single part instead of replacing the whole system, which saves you money over time. And it’s not just about gaming! A gaming PC is a multitasking beast that can handle video editing, graphic design, streaming, and more. It’s the perfect solution for work and play.

### Tips for Watching the Videos

- Take your time. No need to rush.
- Rewatch any parts that feel tricky.
- Some videos are optional—they’re extra resources to dive deeper if you want. Totally up to you if you watch them, but they’re worth checking out!

## About Me

I’ve been messing around with computers for over a decade and have built quite a few. I’m here to share what I’ve learned and help you skip the mistakes I made when I was starting out.

## Disclaimer

- Videos marked with ❗ are **must-watch**—don’t skip them!
- **No single source has all the answers**, which is why I’ve included videos from different creators.
- You might notice some overlap between videos—don’t worry, repetition helps!
- Stick to trustworthy creators so you’re getting reliable info.
- Some videos might be a bit older, but the core principles still apply. So don’t stress about it!

### Guide to Building a Solid PC
I wanted to make a quick guide on what I think makes a solid build. The key to a good build is smart spending. This isn’t about specific parts, but more of a general outline of what you should aim for. It’s important to invest wisely now so you don’t end up paying twice later. Skimping on parts might seem like a good idea in the short term, but you’ll likely have to upgrade sooner than expected when performance starts to lag. Paying a little more upfront ensures that your system remains relevant longer, which saves you the cost (and headache) of having to replace parts prematurely. One last thing: always research what your game or program best benefits from in terms of hardware. Different applications and games have unique demands, so knowing what components they rely on most—whether it's CPU power, GPU performance, or more RAM—will help you allocate your budget more effectively. No single source has all the answers, which is why this is a general outline and not a part for part list. 

Make sure to put together a part list on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and share it on forums. People will help you fine-tune your build—I help people with their part lists all the time on Reddit. Just be clear about what you want to do with your computer and the games or programs you plan to use.

## CPU

Go for at least 8 cores, but I recommend 12 if you can. This increases the ability for multitasking and gaming. Spending a little more now ensures that your CPU will not bottleneck your GPU or slow down under heavier workloads a few years down the road. More cores improve performance and longevity. Also, AMD's X3D chips are currently excellent gaming processors.

## GPU

The big question: [Nvidia or AMD](https://youtu.be/BJ75QVCip88)? Personally, I've never bought an AMD GPU because I believe Nvidia's higher price is justified by better drivers, stability, and features (such as DLSS). Though, AMD provides great specifications at lower prices. My advice is: **12GB of VRAM is required, but 16GB is preferred**. Spend more if you can—going with a higher-end GPU upfront saves you from having to upgrade when newer games require more power. Regarding which AIB to buy, I would refer to this video: [Which Brand of GPU Should You Buy in 2024?](https://youtu.be/LBbU7yBQ9qo). *(Side note: if you do creative work, Nvidia’s CUDA cores have been supported on most creative programs for years, offering a huge boost to rendering and encoding. Check out the first video called NVIDA or AMD for more detail.)*

## Cooler

Cooling is an important factor in your system's performance and longevity. Whether you choose air or liquid, **Noctua** is my go-to company for CPU cooling. Purchase the most expensive **[Noctua cooler you can afford](https://noctua.at/en/products/cpu-cooler-retail/buying-guide-cpu-coolers)**. Better cooling allows your system to run faster for longer periods of time without throttling, reducing the need for frequent upgrades. I recommend **[Noctua's NH-D15 G2](https://youtu.be/0zqPICl5zjA)** or the **[Noctua NH-U12S Redux](https://youtu.be/WhVXxcMex2M)** for a more affordable cooler, but the G2 is still the best. The best AIO is the **[ARCTIC Liquid Freezer](https://youtu.be/jMeH7SJO74Q)**. I would only consider a 360 AIO because there is no reason to choose a 240/280 AIO over the NH-D15 G2. TLDR: Get a Noctua cooler, and if you really want to know what the best cooler is, **[here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeRpPJPxqZlGallbEhUdhZ9OHG1qOQuH&si=g7Ut5VVN5HAxotlR)** is a good place to start. Hardware Canucks has many cooler roundup videos that are hands down the best cooler vs cooler comparisons.

## Motherboard

Never skimp on motherboards. A solid motherboard in the $220-$350 price range will meet your needs and provide greater longevity. If you choose an AMD CPU, investing in a higher-end board can help extend the life of your system because AMD tends to support their platforms for longer. This means you can upgrade your CPU later without having to replace the motherboard.

## Storage

An **NVMe SSD** is a must these days, especially with prices continuing to drop. For the best results, I recommend at least a **1TB SSD with a DRAM buffer**—brands like **Samsung**, **SK Hynix**, and **Crucial** are dependable and offer great long-term performance, reducing the need for early upgrades. If you're on a tighter budget, I suggest sticking to well-reviewed models like the [Silicon Power UD90 SSD](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/silicon-power-ud90-ssd-review) and [TeamGroup MP34](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/team-group-mp34-nvme-ssd,6181.html), as they offer solid value without sacrificing too much performance. In terms of PCIe generations, higher is generally better, but **Gen 5.0** is still expensive and offers minimal real-world benefit for most users—here’s a [video explaining that](https://youtu.be/V7lqJ-X-LsI).

## RAM

More RAM is always beneficial for gaming and productivity. I wouldn't go less than 32GB, but 48GB is perfect for future-proofing. **Spending a little extra now on RAM helps smoother multitasking and gaming, as newer applications require more RAM.**

## Case

**Airflow is critical!** A well-designed mesh case is essential for keeping your PC cool and running smoothly, as poor airflow can lead to overheating, reduced performance, and faster component wear. Brands like **Fractal Design**, **Lian Li**, and **Phanteks** offer some of the best airflow-focused cases, while **be quiet!** prioritizes low noise with solid airflow, though their cases tend to run warmer than other high-airflow options. For first-time builders, I highly recommend the [Lian Li 207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0ZYG6j0RDM/), a fantastic, no-nonsense choice that makes building a PC easy and hassle-free.

## PSU

A good PSU will last you through multiple builds. My go-to for finding what is a good PSU is the [PSU Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/edit?pli=1&gid=1719706335#gid=1719706335), and I always strive for **A Tier**. Don't settle for lower-rated PSUs that may fail under load and damage your components. Spending more here on a high-quality PSU, such as a **Seasonic PSU**, will last you much longer than cheaper power supplies. For wattage, I recommend a 1000W PSU. It provides consistent power delivery and allows for future upgrades, saving you money because you don't have to replace it later.

## Fans 

When choosing PC fans, I consider quality, performance, and noise. I have a couple of favorites based on your budget. If I want the best, it's **Noctua** all the time. Their fans, such as the NF-A12x25 and NF-A14, are extremely quiet, provide excellent airflow, and last forever. That being said, if you don't like Noctua's colors or want RGB, I recommend **be quiet!**. Their Silent Wings and Pure Wings series look wonderful, run quietly, and provide reliable performance. If I want to stay inside a budget, **Arctic** fans like the P12 and P14 provide surprisingly effective cooling for the price. No matter what I'm building, one of these brands is typically a good fit.  

  


By investing in quality parts now, you’re ensuring your PC performs well for longer, which saves you the cost and hassle of frequent upgrades. A well-built PC with the right parts can last for years without needing major replacements.

If you need a full part list, the first place to look is YouTube I have some linked below. There are tons of ways to create a list, but here are a few ideas for now. If you need assistance, forms such as PC Part Picker, Reddit, and LTT Forms are excellent options. Simply post pictures of parts or a link to a PC Part Picker list. Another suggestion is that people on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=pc%20part%20list&source=main_banner&ref_ctx_id=623c2b5dde3a437b984c31b6bba255bc&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=pc%20part%20list) charge a small fee to help you create a list tailored to your specific needs.

## 6. Long Term PC Maintenance

To keep your PC running smoothly for years to come, here are some simple but effective tips:

### 1. Dust It Off Regularly
Dust can mess with airflow, leading to higher temps and slower performance. Every few months, grab some compressed air and clean out your fans, filters, and case. Keeping your system dust-free helps maintain optimal cooling and performance.

### 2. Update Drivers and Firmware
It might sound tedious, but keeping your drivers and firmware up to date ensures compatibility with new hardware, software, and games. Plus, it often improves system stability and performance.

### 3. Monitor Storage Health
