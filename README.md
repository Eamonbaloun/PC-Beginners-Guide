If you looking to build a gaming PC in late 2020 please do not just go, ask your tech friend or family member &quot;can you build me a gaming pc.&quot; (this offends me because part of getting a gaming pc is that it is not plug and play like a console if you want easy get a console the ps5 and Xbox series x are powerhouses with minimal setup) So if this guide was sent to you please clear you schedule because this will take some time. Also it is ok to go back and watch the videos again if needed, but I would watch as many videos as you can because it makes the experience better when the pc you built is 100% yours.

I love computers I have been an enthusiast for over 10 years and have built and setup many computers. I want to help people get into this hobby that I have come to love so much. That is why I am going make a guide for new people getting into PC gaming.

- _Disclaimer there will be a lot of overlap in most of videos that was done on purpose I did not understand everythinng the first time learning about them._
- _All the videos I have linked are 100% accurate and I would stick with people I have liked not everyone on YouTube gives the right information. The only other thing I would say is if it from 2019 there have been new CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s so not everything has up to date hardware, but the information and concepts are still good none the less._

1. Picking Parts

- Now that you have some sort of an idea of what you need to build a pc lets choose some parts. ([Refer to this video if you need a quick refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O8kr0KlkBM))

First what I would do before choosing parts is find out what resolution and refresh rate you will be trying to game at. ([Refer to this video on what that all means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50c82iC0PU))

- [How to correctly choose parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DcWgxMZ3k)

- [How to Make Sure All Your Computer Hardware Parts Are Compatible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfjm7fSLWE) - _PCI gen 4 is out since this video was made B450 and x570 motherboards support it on AMD no intel boards support it but it is coming for intel._

- [32GB of Ram vs 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_QPQowp2UE&amp;t=28s)-|- [Does 32GB of Ram REALLY Make a Difference in Your PC ???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JupBvOfoHjA&amp;t=396s) (_please watch both videos_) If you are planning to use your gaming PC for something else like your job and you work with Adobe software or engineering software like CAD or solid works then I would recommend 32 gigs as a minimum. (it may seem expensive but if you follow the pc hardware deals, I linked below you can get kits of ram cheap do not let the price scare you)

  - [GPU and CPU Pairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AihX9OjqnYc) â€“ This video will show the best CPU and GPU combos to prevent bottlenecking

- PC Cases
  - When looking for a case I would always check out Gamers Nexus they have the best-case reviews, and they are not afraid to say something negative even if they were sent the case for review.
    - [PC cases playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OupiPZybyBE&amp;list=PLsuVSmND84QtrMP_niRTD2zIa3uUhxIvn)
      - You can also look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYYq1QXts_Y&amp;t=28s) to understand what makes a good PC case (Optional)
        - Last thing about PC cases just because a case has fancy lighting does not mean it is good for airflow don&#39;t be fooled by fancy lighting there are a lot of cases on the market that have lighting and still don&#39;t compromise on airflow. Also just because one of your favorite streamers uses a specific case does not it mean it&#39;s a good case I know [nadeshot&#39;s cash app compound facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7tLhqWB2Q&amp;t=315s) for esports and streamers uses NZXT cases for every pc in the building those aren&#39;t bad cases but just because they use them doesn&#39;t mean you need to.

- 2020 Part lists!

One thing to remember is if you go with a really budget build ($700 or less) it may cost you more money down the line when you have you upgrade because your trying to play the newest games and you bought a 6 core chip or only16 gigs of ram because it was &quot;recommended&quot; but very soon the minimum and recommended specs for all games will go up and it may be better to buy the higher end part to future proof yourself instead of having to spend $200 on a CPU and in only 2 years found out that you need to spend another $200 to upgrade because you&#39;re not getting performance that is needed to play the game smoothly or at the settings you want to play the game at. ([this video explains it better)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnRjlsvJ3Y&amp;t=517s)

_As of September 2020 new graphics cars have come out and if you can find them in stock the 3070 is faster than the 2080ti and the 3080 is a 4k 60 fps beast and is above anything that has previously been released_

  - [High end 2020 Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2PnPN8vVUo)
  - [The Herd Mentality PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mODI4-cRhPE&amp;t=405s) - the case is a little unconventional, but this build has some of the best parts you can buy right now on new egg. (all of the parts come with warranties included with some parts having up to a 6 year warranty)
  - [Budget builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-316YvzhrQ&amp;t=18s)
  - [More budget builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbAq031smbs)
  - [I Built the Xbox Series X as a PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd2J_Mc0PJo) â€“ I really like this build it is really compact and quiet I would definitely build this if I was looking for a Xbox killer.
  - [PS5 Killer PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tJjb0g_hw&amp;t=365s)- Consoles are not PC&#39;s even if they are using AMD parts. This PC part list is similarly priced to a PS5 that is why it is called a PS5 killer. ([This video explains the differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWzf7jFwbQA&amp;t=171s))

Active deals!!!

- [Pc hardware Deals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCss3QxegBkF8BAetIo0qXA) â€“ This channel streams all the time some of the best deals you can currently find on the market and also is focused on what is the best value for your money I would check there channel if you have a question what is better for the money.
- I would also check out [dealsource.tech](https://www.dealsource.tech/deals-1) this websites gets updated every day with deals they don&#39;t have as many pc hardware deals but they do post a lot of storage deals if you want to get good storage for cheap this is place to look. (_if you click a link and buy something it supports the people that make this website_)

2.5 Prebuilt

- If you don&#39;t want to build the pc yourself then I would look at [NZXT BLD](https://www.letsbld.com/) service. You can find all about the service in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSDpawYkqAo&amp;t=75s) video. (Building is always cheaper and better, but if for some reason you do not want to build it yourself then this is one of the best ways to go about a prebuilt.)
- Another option for pre-built computers is if you have a Micro Center near you that is really good way to get help with your first PC. They offer pre-built computers from parts you pick out. [This video is review of the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&amp;t=245s)

1. Building

This step is not as hard as it seems I would only start building when you have all the parts. The main YouTuber I would recommend for building computers is[careyholzman](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareyHolzman). He is the best at showing what goes where and explaining why he does things the way he does. Below are some of his build videos please watch at least one from start to finish on your own before you build the pc. Then watch the video again as a step by step guide when putting it together.

- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfbEcDff2Z0)
- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-j9ILxpsCA)
- I also have one build from another youtuber that is also good I would check it out if you have difficulty understanding Carey. _(BTW this video is in POV, so it is easy to see what to do)_
  - [How to build a PC (POV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MYOpFONCU&amp;t=554s)
- Here is a [beginners guide to gaming PC&#39;s](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnHcRQUxuoeQM4-llcMNXTakKZcAAyB6) playlist this will be another place to check when you come across something you may not know. _(these videos are optional)_
- I will also include some tip videos from other Youtubers that are helpful to know before you build.

1. Optimizing Windows- \ ***Please do not skip this step it is so important\***

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for I have helped friends who bought a 144hz monitor and never went into the Nvidia control panel and swapped it from 60hz to 144hz so the entire time they had owned that monitor they were never using the 144hz that they paid for. (also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4))

**Watch as many of these videos as you can**

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)- Please watch this video it is important that you setup windows and turn on XMP for your ram.

- [Programs needed to continue](http://www.mediafire.com/file/e7l0k7d43swdxn8/Ninite_Chrome_Discord_Steam_VLC_WinRAR_Installer.exe/file)

- [Windows settings](https://youtu.be/jCB1a1hokwg?t=5450) - what I recommend is if you click the link it will start the video near the end he shows some programs that make setting up windows really easy I would follow the settings he uses but just as a rule don&#39;t disable camera or microphone and also skip anything about windows apps a video further down covers windows apps everything else is up to you. (If your camera and microphone do not work after restarting than click [this link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/zn7wsne0s2l74ro/Fix_Microphone_%2526_Camera.reg/file) and run this file) (if you really want the best performance you can watch the whole video, but just to let you know the programs he shows will do most of what he shows for you in a nice simple menu, but if you really want to learn windows and how to use it watch the whole video)

- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&amp;t=457s) - this guide will slightly cut into windows functionality I would recommend skipping from 11:50 to 17:50 skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store. Also, for this video I would skip disabling services the overwatch A-Z video has a way of doing this. (skip anything about windows apps)

- [Windows Apps the right way to remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6OT_QcHaU) â€“ this is how to remove windows app in the best way.

- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS &amp; Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&amp;t=228s) - even if you don&#39;t play overwatch this guide is still really good it cover almost everything I would recommend without cutting into windows functionality at all so please if you want to make windows snapper for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial then at lease watch this one. (skip anything about windows apps)

- [Making and Editing Debloat Scripts for Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y53p1d5P6LA) - this video will cover how to edit your own script that will optimize windows for you I would follow this video and make your script and then run the script once a month to make sure your settings are still set the way you want them (windows likes to reset them once and while)

- [How to REALLY make Windows 10 Super Light for Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU5F01oOzQQ&amp;t=2s) â€“ this is another video that shows how you can use scrips to make windows light for gaming.

- If you are looking to play a specific game and want the best settings than look for a guide by [Panjno](https://www.youtube.com/user/PanjnoTutorials)
  - [Call of duty Warzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU8S3srYtbg)
  - [Rainbow six siege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5psNE7nGCg)
  - [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFnl2dZfQo)
  - [Apex Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdqvkbDP4Dc)
  - [GPU overclock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1dGwFOdFLI&amp;t=646s)
  - [Nvidia settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZrnfWpENTo&amp;t=464s)
  - [AMD settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1N4vV5BSoI)
  - [WIFI settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAke9R-k3so&amp;t=181s)

- If you are looking for the best performance and fully tweaked pc then you want to look at the youtuber[FR33THY](https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth) and his A-Z series for settings up windows. This will make windows light for gaming but will cut into the functionality of windows a lot. So only do what you feel is best for you and your needs.

I really think that if you were to watch every video, I provided in this guide you should be more than capable of building and or upgrading your own computer.
