If you looking to build a gaming PC in late 2020 please do not just go, ask your tech friend or family member &quot;can you build me a gaming pc.&quot; (this offends me because part of getting a gaming pc is that it is not plug and play like a console if you want easy get a console the ps5 and xbox series x are powerhouses with minimal setup) So if this guide was sent to you please clear you schedule because this will take some time.

I love computers I have been an enthusiast for over 10 years and have built and setup many computers. I want to help people get into this hobby that I have come to love so much. That is why I am going make a guide for new people getting into PC gaming.

- _Disclaimer there will be a lot of overlap in most of videos that was done on purpose I did not get everything on my first time learning about them._
- _Also make sure that you check when the video was made. all the videos I have linked are 100% accurate and the only thing I would say is if it from 2019 there have been new CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s so not everything has up to date hardware, but are still good videos none the less._

1. Picking Parts

Now that you have some sort of an idea of what you need to build a pc lets choose some parts.

First what I would do before choosing parts is find out what resolution and hertz you will be trying to game at. ([Refer to this video on what that all means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50c82iC0PU))

- [How to correctly choose parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DcWgxMZ3k)
- [Here&#39;s what Bottlenecking REALLY looks like!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLkV5yoCUkk)
- [Here&#39;s PROOF you do not need to overspend on a CPU in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOq6Deqc-N0&amp;t=365s)
- [How to Pick PC Parts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa5j_eiPATw)
- [How To Make Sure All Your Computer Hardware Parts Are Compatible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfjm7fSLWE) â€“ _PCI gen 4 is out since this video was made B450 and x570 motherboards support it on AMD no intel boards support it but it is coming for intel._

- [How to Choose a Motherboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP-pinlU-Ko)
- When looking for a case I would definitely check out Gamers Nexus they have the best case reviews and they are not afraid to say something negative even if they were sent the case for review.
  - [PC cases playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OupiPZybyBE&amp;list=PLsuVSmND84QtrMP_niRTD2zIa3uUhxIvn)
  - You can also look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omxziF-oa-A) to understand what makes a good PC case

- 2020 Part lists!

_As of September 2020 new graphics cars have come out and if you can find them in stock the 3070 is faster than the 2080ti and the 3080 is a 4k 60 fps beast and is above any of the 20 series cards_

1. Building

This step is not as hard as it seems I would only start building when you have all the parts. The main YouTuber I would recommend for building computers is[careyholzman](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareyHolzman). He is the best at showing what goes where and explaining why he does things the way he does. Below are some of his build videos please watch at least one from start to finish on your own before you build the pc. Then watch the video again as a step by step guide when putting it together.

- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfbEcDff2Z0)
- [Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-j9ILxpsCA)
- I also have one build from another youtuber that is also good I would check it out if you have difficulty understanding Carey. _(BTW this video is in POV so it is really easy to see what to do)_
  - [How to build a PC (POV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MYOpFONCU&amp;t=554s)
- Here is a [beginners guide to gaming PC&#39;s](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnHcRQUxuoeQM4-llcMNXTakKZcAAyB6) playlist this will be another place to check when you come across something you may not know. _(these videos are optional)_
- I will also include some tip videos from other Youtubers that are helpful to know before you build.

1. Optimizing Windows- \ ***Please don&#39;t skip this step it is so important\***

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for I have helped friends who bought a 144hz monitor and never went into the Nvidia control panel and swapped it from 60hz to 144hz so the entire time they had owned that monitor they were never using the 144hz that they paid for. (also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4))

**Watch as many of these videos as you can**

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)- Please watch this video it is important that you setup windows and turn on XMP for your ram.

- [Programs needed to continue](http://www.mediafire.com/file/e7l0k7d43swdxn8/Ninite_Chrome_Discord_Steam_VLC_WinRAR_Installer.exe/file)

- [Windows settings](https://youtu.be/jCB1a1hokwg?t=5450) - what I recommend is if you click the link it will start near the end of video he shows some programs that make setting up windows really easy I would follow the settings he uses but just as a rule don&#39;t disable camera or microphone and also skip anything about windows apps a video further down covers windows apps everything else is up to you. (If your camera and microphone do not work after restarting than click [this link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/zn7wsne0s2l74ro/Fix_Microphone_%2526_Camera.reg/file) and run this file) (if you really want the best performance you can watch the whole video, but just to let you know the programs he shows will do most of what he shows for you in a nice simple menu, but if you really want to learn windows and how to use it watch the whole video)

- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&amp;t=457s) - this guide will slightly cut into windows functionality I would recommend skipping from 11:50 to 17:50 skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store. Also, for this video I would skip disabling services the overwatch A-Z video has a way of doing this. (skip anything about windows apps)

- [Windows Apps the right way to remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6OT_QcHaU) â€“ this is how to remove windows app in the best way.

- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS &amp; Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&amp;t=228s) - even if you don&#39;t play overwatch this guide is still really good it cover almost everything I would recommend without cutting into windows functionality at all so please if you want to make windows snapper for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial then at lease watch this one. (skip anything about windows apps)

- [Making and Editing Debloat Scripts for Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y53p1d5P6LA) - this video will cover how to edit your own script that will optimize windows for you I would follow this video and make your script and then run the script once a month to make sure your settings are still set the way you want them (windows likes to reset them once and while)

- If you are looking to play a specific game and want the best settings than look for a guide by [Panjno](https://www.youtube.com/user/PanjnoTutorials)
  - [Call of duty Warzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU8S3srYtbg)
  - [Rainbow six siege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5psNE7nGCg)
  - [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFnl2dZfQo)
  - [Apex Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdqvkbDP4Dc)
  - [GPU overclock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1dGwFOdFLI&amp;t=646s)
  - [Nvidia settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZrnfWpENTo&amp;t=464s)
  - [AMD settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1N4vV5BSoI)
  - [WIFI settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAke9R-k3so&amp;t=181s)

- If you are looking for the best performance and fully tweaked pc then you want to look at the youtuber[FR33THY](https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth) and his A-Z series for settings up windows. This will make windows light for gaming but will cut into the functionality of windows a lot. So only do what you feel is best for you and your needs.

I really think that if you were to watch every video, I provided in this guide you should be more than capable of building and or upgrading your own computer.
