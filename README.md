If you looking to build a gaming pc late 2020 please don&#39;t just go, ask your tech friend or family member to just &quot;do it.&quot;

I love computers I have been an enthusiast for over 10 years and have built and setup many computers. I want to help people get into this hobby that I have come to love so much. That is why I am going make a guide for new people getting into PC gaming.

1. Understanding what each part does and why you need it (plus more)

1. Picking Parts

Now that you have some sort of an idea of what you need to build a pc lets choose some parts

1. Building

this step is not as hard as it seems I would only start building when you have all the parts.

There is only one youtuber I would recommend for this part and that is[careyholzman](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareyHolzman)

He is the best at showing what goes where and explaining why he does things the way he does here are some of his build videos please watch at lease one from start to finish on your own before you build the pc then watch the video again as a step by step guide when putting it together.

1. Windows

This step takes the longest and is the most important for making sure you get the most out of what you pay for.

- [FREE programs that EVERY PC should have...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRbMfZKuRUo)
- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&amp;t=457s) this guide will slightly cut into windows functionality I would recommend skipping from 11:50 to 17:50 skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store.

- If you are looking to play a specific games and want the best settings than look for a guide by [Panjno](https://www.youtube.com/user/PanjnoTutorials)
  - [Call of duty Warzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU8S3srYtbg)
  - [Rainbow six siege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5psNE7nGCg)
  - [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFnl2dZfQo)
  - [Apex Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdqvkbDP4Dc)
  - [GPU overclock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1dGwFOdFLI&amp;t=646s)
  - [Nvidia settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZrnfWpENTo&amp;t=464s)
  - [AMD settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1N4vV5BSoI)
  - [WIFI settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAke9R-k3so&amp;t=181s)
- If you are looking for the best performance and fully tweaked pc then you want to look at the youtuber[FR33THY](https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth) and his A-Z series for settings up windows. This will make windows light for gaming but will cut into the functionality of windows a lot. So only do what you feel is best for you and your needs.
