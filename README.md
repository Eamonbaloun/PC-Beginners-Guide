### Parts Lists

🚨 **Top Recommendations for Builds** 🚨

I wanted to make a quick guide on what I think makes a solid build. The key to a good build is smart spending. This isn’t about specific parts, but more of a general outline of what you should aim for. *[More of anything is always better—it keeps you from buying twice!]* Make sure to put together a part list on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and share it on forums. People will help you fine-tune your build—I help people with their part lists all the time on Reddit. Just be clear about what you want to do with your computer and the games or programs you plan to use.

- **CPU**: Go for at least 8 cores, but I recommend 12 if you can. It’ll give you more headroom for multitasking and gaming.

- **GPU**: The big question: [Nvidia or AMD](https://youtu.be/BJ75QVCip88)? Personally, I’ve never bought an AMD GPU because I find Nvidia’s price premium worth it for better drivers, stability, and features (DLSS). That said, I respect what AMD is doing with better specs at lower prices. For a recommendation, 12GB of VRAM is the minimum, but 16GB is ideal. Just get the best card you can afford with at least 12GB or 16GB VRAM. *(Side note: if you do things other than gaming, Nvidia’s CUDA cores have been supported on most creative programs for years and this means most creative apps get a big boost to rendering and encoding thanks to the many years of updates he explains this in the video I linked really well.)*

- **Cooler**: For air cooling, grab the most expensive Noctua cooler (like the NH-D15) that fits your budget. If you prefer an AIO, the **ARCTIC Liquid Freezer** offers solid performance at a good price.

- **Motherboard**: Never skimp on the motherboard. A decent board in the $220–$350 range will cover your needs, but if you’re going with AMD, investing in a better board is a smart move. AMD tends to support boards longer, so you could upgrade the CPU in a few years without changing the board.

- **Storage**: An **NVMe SSD** is the only thing I’d consider these days since they’re so affordable. For storage size, 1TB drives are really cheap now. I can’t stress enough how important a DRAM buffer is—if a drive has one, it’ll say so. I recommend brands like **Samsung, SK Hynix, or Crucial**—they’re all reliable.

- **RAM**: Simple—more is always better. I wouldn’t go below 32GB, but 48GB is ideal, especially for gaming and productivity.

- **Case**: Go for airflow, airflow, airflow! A mesh design is key. As long as it gets good reviews for airflow (check out Gamers Nexus or Hardware Canucks for that), you’re good. Personally, I’d recommend **Fractal Design** or **Lian Li**—both offer great airflow options. Tho If I had to recomend one case [Corsair 5000D AIRFLOW](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-cases/cc-9011210-ww/5000d-airflow-tempered-glass-mid-tower-atx-pc-case-black-cc-9011210-ww) this case it as strait forward as they get 

- **PSU**: This one’s straightforward, thanks to the [PSU Tier List](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/). Finding a good power supply is easy—just get one in the **A Tier**. 1000W PSUs are getting more affordable, so wait for a sale and go with a trusted brand. **Seasonic** is my favorite—they’re reliable and top quality.

## 2.5 Prebuilt - (Optional)

If you’re thinking about going the prebuilt route, it’s important to know what you’re getting into. Prebuilts can be convenient, but sometimes you end up paying more for less. Watch these videos so you can make sure you’re not overpaying or getting stuck with low-quality components.

- [Warnings About Pre-Built PCs: Proprietary Parts, Monthly Charges, & Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxBogvUe_c&t=340s)
- [Are Pre-Built Gaming PCs Better In 2024?](https://youtu.be/9h8d8mrPSuY) – A great video explaining why pre-built PCs might not be the best option.
- [Linus Tech Tips’ Secret Shopper Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw) is awesome. They went undercover and bought prebuilt PCs to review—definitely worth a watch to understand what’s good and bad.

- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA) also has a series of videos to help find a solid prebuilt. Here are a few of my favorites:
  - [Corsair | $4,700 Pre-Built Gaming PC Review (Corsair One I500)](https://youtu.be/Gqm4V-8F-7k)
  - [NZXT BLD Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY-SEPGvqxY&t=831s)
  - [Starforge Review](https://youtu.be/W9YiOLX5uQU) – If you want a good prebuilt, this one is probably the best reviewed by Gamers Nexus.
  - [Cyberpower $1000 Pre-Built Gaming PC Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68aE1za_Ak&t=268s)
  - [iBUYPOWER Pre-Built Gaming PC Slate MR1004 Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sDRiakWcIM&t=1280s)
  - [Dell G5 5000 PC's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMg6hUudHE) -|- [Dell's Dumpster Fire: Bloatware Uses 30% Gpu (G5 5000 Review & Benchmarks)](https://youtu.be/5N7aYtkzKJc)
  - [110°C VRAM Dell GTX 1660 Super Video Card Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaJZq13tr8&t=193s) – This is a review of a really bad graphics card included with a Dell prebuilt PC.

A bunch of other videos show how shady some prebuilt PC companies can be:
  - [Why Most Pre-Builds Suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P19r1LSNsiU)
  - [Review of $549 STGAubron Gaming PC](https://youtu.be/HbYLQGmOXUo)

  - [These Gaming PCs Are a SCAM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmgCxpClPU)
  - [Asking Best Buy for a Gaming PC Recommendation](https://youtu.be/MbhzL57tBNA)

If you’re leaning toward buying a prebuilt, I also recommend Dawid Does Tech Stuff—he reviews a ton of [prebuilt gaming PCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ_lYVp9TMg&list=PLT515qV87IFLt4RpKB0yahoesNMDX-Jma). Super helpful before making your decision.

### Good Prebuilds:

- **Starforge PCs** are getting some attention for their high-quality builds. They’re owned by streamers who understand the gaming community’s needs, and they’re super responsive to feedback. After some initial criticism from Gamers Nexus, one of the owners responded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY4au05ukho), which really shows their commitment to improving their products. If you’re looking for a good prebuilt, Starforge is a solid option.
- **ABS PCs** from NewEgg are another decent prebuilt option. They are built with off-the-shelf parts, so they can be upgraded easily. Dawid Does Tech Stuff reviewed [this ABS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APy_TyQSpPI), and while it ran a little hot, he made [a follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZhIpX97v0) showing how $50 in extra fans fixed that. For esports games, this prebuilt will run smoothly at over 60 fps. this is by no means a fancy or high end system but for a big brand to do this well it deserves a metion.
- **Micro Center**: If you’ve got a Micro Center nearby, they’ll build a PC from parts you select. It’s a great option for anyone new to PCs. [Here’s a review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&t=245s) of the service.

## 4. Optimizing Windows

Don’t skip this step! It's super important if you want to get the most out of your gaming rig. Some friends of mine bought a 144Hz monitor but never changed it from 60Hz in the Nvidia control panel, so they never actually got to use it to its full potential. 

All of the guides below are legit, even if your antivirus thinks otherwise (I’ve scanned them all on [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4)):

([Here’s another vid if you need more info](https://youtu.be/OBPreMucWf0)).
