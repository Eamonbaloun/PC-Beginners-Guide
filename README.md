# Beginner's Guide to Building a Gaming PC

Hey! So you're new to building your own gaming PC? No worries, I got you! This guide is made just for you. Building can feel a bit overwhelming at first, but trust me, with the right help, you'll have your dream gaming setup running in no time.

## Why Build Your Own Gaming PC?

Building your own gaming PC isn’t just about saving money—it's about getting more value and control. Unlike consoles, a custom PC allows you to handpick parts to achieve graphics quality and performance levels that consoles can’t match. With a powerful GPU, you’ll experience smoother frame rates, higher resolutions, and options like ray tracing that elevate your gaming visuals. And while a console becomes outdated over time, a PC can be upgraded part by part, saving you money in the long run.

Plus, a gaming PC doesn’t stop at gaming: you can tackle tasks like video editing, graphic design, and streaming, making it an all-in-one powerhouse that’s ready for both play and productivity.

## What You'll Find in This Guide

I’ve got you covered from start to finish—choosing the right parts to actually putting your rig together. 

### Tips for Watching the Videos

### Parts Lists

🚨 **Top Recommendations for Builds** 🚨

**AT THE MOMENT I CAN'T RECOMEND INTEL CPU'S 13TH and 14TH GEN** *([click here to find out why](https://youtu.be/gTeubeCIwRw))*

Guide to Building a Solid PC

I wanted to make a quick guide on what I think makes a solid build. The key to a good build is smart spending. This isn’t about specific parts, but more of a general outline of what you should aim for. It’s important to invest wisely now so you don’t end up paying twice later. Skimping on parts might seem like a good idea in the short term, but you’ll likely have to upgrade sooner than expected when performance starts to lag. Paying a little more upfront ensures that your system remains relevant longer, which saves you the cost (and headache) of having to replace parts prematurely. One last thing: always research what your game or program best benefits from in terms of hardware. Different applications and games have unique demands, so knowing what components they rely on most—whether it's CPU power, GPU performance, or more RAM—will help you allocate your budget more effectively. No single source has all the answers, which is why you'll find multiple videos from different creators included here. 

Make sure to put together a part list on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and share it on forums. People will help you fine-tune your build—I help people with their part lists all the time on Reddit. Just be clear about what you want to do with your computer and the games or programs you plan to use.

### CPU
Go for at least 8 cores, but I recommend 12 if you can. This increases the ability for multitasking and gaming. Spending a little more now ensures that your CPU will not bottleneck your GPU or slow down under heavier workloads a few years down the road. More cores improve performance and longevity. Also, AMD's X3D chips are currently excellent gaming processors.

### GPU
The big question: [Nvidia or AMD](https://youtu.be/BJ75QVCip88)? Personally, I've never bought an AMD GPU because I believe Nvidia's higher price is justified by better drivers, stability, and features (such as DLSS). Though, AMD provides great specifications at lower prices. My advice is: **12GB of VRAM is required, but 16GB is preferred**. Spend more if you can—going with a higher-end GPU upfront saves you from having to upgrade when newer games require more power. Regarding which AIB to buy, I would refer to this video. [Which Brand of GPU Should You Buy in 2024?](https://youtu.be/LBbU7yBQ9qo)
*(Side note: if you do creative work, Nvidia’s CUDA cores have been supported on most creative programs for years, offering a huge boost to rendering and encoding. Check out the first video called NVIDA or AMD for more detail.)*

### Cooler
Cooling is an important factor in your system's performance and longevity. Whether you choose air or liquid, **Noctua is my go-to company for CPU cooling. Purchase the most expensive [Noctua cooler you can afford](https://noctua.at/en/products/cpu-cooler-retail/buying-guide-cpu-coolers).** Better cooling allows your system to run faster for longer periods of time without throttling, reducing the need for frequent upgrades. I recommend **[Noctua's NH-D15 G2](https://youtu.be/0zqPICl5zjA)** or the **[Noctua NH-U12S Redux](https://youtu.be/WhVXxcMex2M)** for a more affordable cooler, but the G2 is still the best. The best AIO is the [ARCTIC Liquid Freezer](https://youtu.be/jMeH7SJO74Q)**. I would only consider a 360 aio because there is no reason to choose a 240/280 aio over the NH-D15 G2. TLDR Get a Noctua cooler, and if you really want to know what the best cooler is, [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeRpPJPxqZlGallbEhUdhZ9OHG1qOQuH&si=g7Ut5VVN5HAxotlR) is a good place to start. Hardware Canucks has many cooler roundup videos that are hands down the best cooler vs cooler comparisons.

### Motherboard
Never skimp on motherboards. A solid motherboard in the $220-$350 price range will meet your needs and provide greater longevity. If you choose a AMD CPU, investing in a higher-end board can help extend the life of your system because AMD tends to support their platforms for longer. This means you can upgrade your CPU later without having to replace the motherboard.

### Storage
An **NVMe SSD** is a must these days, especially with the costs of them dropping. For the best results, I would buy at least 1TB ssd with a DRAM buffer. **Samsung, SK Hynix, and Crucial** are dependable brands. Higher-quality drives improve performance over time and eliminate the need for an early update. as for which PCIE GEN higher is better but 5.0 atm is really expensive and not that much of a difference here is a [video explaining that](https://youtu.be/V7lqJ-X-LsI).

### RAM
More RAM is always beneficial for gaming and productivity. I wouldn't go less than 32GB, but 48GB is perfect for future-proofing. **Spending a little extra now on RAM helps smoother multitasking and gaming, as newer applications require more RAM.**

### Case
**Airflow is critical! ** A well-designed mesh case is vital for keeping your PC cool and running smoothly. Overheating can reduce performance and accelerate wear on components. Brands like as **Fractal Design**, **Lian Li**, and **Be Quiet** provide outstanding airflow-focused cases. For first-time builders, I highly recommend the [Corsair 5000D AIRFLOW](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-cases/cc-9011210-ww/5000d-airflow-tempered-glass-mid-tower-atx-pc-case-black-cc-9011210-ww), which is a great, no-nonsense choice.

### PSU
A good PSU will last you through multiple builds. My go too for finding what is a good PSU is the [PSU Tier List](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/) and I always strive for **A Tier**. Don't settle for lower-rated PSUs that may fail under load and damage your components. Spending more here on a high-quality PSU, such as a **Seasonic PSU**  will last you a lot longer than cheaper power supplies. For how may Watts I would go with a 1000W PSU, they provide consistent power delivery and allows for future upgrades, saving you money becasue you don't have to replace later. 


By investing in quality parts now, you’re ensuring your PC performs well for longer, which saves you the cost and hassle of frequent upgrades. A well-built PC with the right parts can last for years without needing major replacements.

Here are some good builds from youtubers that show full part lists so if that is something your looking for here are some good choices.

## 2.5 Prebuilt - (Optional)

If you’re thinking about going the prebuilt route, it’s important to know what you’re getting into. Prebuilts can be convenient, but sometimes you end up paying more for less. Watch these videos so you can make sure you’re not overpaying or getting stuck with low-quality components.

- [Warnings About Pre-Built PCs: Proprietary Parts, Monthly Charges, & Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxBogvUe_c&t=340s)
- [Are Pre-Built Gaming PCs Better In 2024?](https://youtu.be/9h8d8mrPSuY) – A great video explaining why pre-built PCs might not be the best option.
- [Linus Tech Tips’ Secret Shopper Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw) is awesome. They went undercover and bought prebuilt PCs to review—definitely worth a watch to understand what’s good and bad.
  - [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7WMF4wWko)
  - [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2kCUbY4ZWs&t=439s)

  - [$1500 PC Secret Shopper 2 Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go5tLO6ipxw&t=1157s)
- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA) also has a series of videos to help find a solid prebuilt. Here are a few of my favorites:
  - [Corsair | $4,700 Pre-Built Gaming PC Review (Corsair One I500)](https://youtu.be/Gqm4V-8F-7k)
  - [NZXT BLD Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY-SEPGvqxY&t=831s)
  - [Starforge Review](https://youtu.be/W9YiOLX5uQU) – If you want a good prebuilt, this one is probably the best reviewed by Gamers Nexus.
  - [Cyberpower $1000 Pre-Built Gaming PC Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68aE1za_Ak&t=268s)
  - [iBUYPOWER Pre-Built Gaming PC Slate MR1004 Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sDRiakWcIM&t=1280s)
  - [Dell G5 5000 PC's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMg6hUudHE) -|- [Dell's Dumpster Fire: Bloatware Uses 30% Gpu (G5 5000 Review & Benchmarks)](https://youtu.be/5N7aYtkzKJc)
  - [110°C VRAM Dell GTX 1660 Super Video Card Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaJZq13tr8&t=193s) – This is a review of a really bad graphics card included with a Dell prebuilt PC.

A bunch of other videos show how shady some prebuilt PC companies can be:
  - [Why Most Pre-Builds Suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P19r1LSNsiU)
  - [Review of $549 STGAubron Gaming PC](https://youtu.be/HbYLQGmOXUo)

  - [These Gaming PCs Are a SCAM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmgCxpClPU)
  - [Asking Best Buy for a Gaming PC Recommendation](https://youtu.be/MbhzL57tBNA)

If you’re leaning toward buying a prebuilt, I also recommend Dawid Does Tech Stuff—he reviews a ton of [prebuilt gaming PCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ_lYVp9TMg&list=PLT515qV87IFLt4RpKB0yahoesNMDX-Jma). Super helpful before making your decision.

### Good Prebuilds:

- **Starforge PCs** are getting some attention for their high-quality builds. They’re owned by streamers who understand the gaming community’s needs, and they’re super responsive to feedback. After some initial criticism from Gamers Nexus, one of the owners responded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY4au05ukho), which really shows their commitment to improving their products. If you’re looking for a good prebuilt, Starforge is a solid option.
- **ABS PCs** from NewEgg are another decent prebuilt option. They are built with off-the-shelf parts, so they can be upgraded easily. Dawid Does Tech Stuff reviewed [this ABS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APy_TyQSpPI), and while it ran a little hot, he made [a follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZhIpX97v0) showing how $50 in extra fans fixed that. For esports games, this prebuilt will run smoothly at over 60 fps. this is by no means a fancy or high end system but for a big brand to do this well it deserves a metion.
- **Micro Center**: If you’ve got a Micro Center nearby, they’ll build a PC from parts you select. It’s a great option for anyone new to PCs. [Here’s a review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&t=245s) of the service.
- **Falcon Northwest** They're a really good choice if you're looking for a very high-end, hand-built custom PC with top-quality parts and real customer care. Definitely a solid choice. They've been making custom computers since 1992, so they've been in the game for over 30 years.

## 4. Optimizing Windows

Don’t skip this step! It's super important if you want to get the most out of your gaming rig. Some friends of mine bought a 144Hz monitor but never changed it from 60Hz in the Nvidia control panel, so they never actually got to use it to its full potential. 

All of the guides below are legit, even if your antivirus thinks otherwise (I’ve scanned them all on [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4)):

## 6. Long Term PC Maintenance
Alright, so for keeping your PC in top shape long-term, there are a few easy things that make a difference. First off, give it a dust-off every now and then—just grab some compressed air and clear out the fans and filters. Dust buildup can mess with airflow, which means higher temps and slower performance. Make sure you’re updating drivers and firmware, too. I know it sounds tedious, but it really helps with compatibility and keeps everything running smoother with new stuff you install.
Also, keep an eye on your storage health—nothing worse than a sudden drive failure and losing everything. Definitely back up anything important. And if you haven’t thought about it, consider reapplying thermal paste on your CPU and GPU every couple of years; it’s a simple way to keep temps down and performance up, especially if you’ve got good-quality paste on there.
