# 2020 Part lists!

One thing to keep in mind is that if you go with a low-cost build ($700 or less), you may end up spending more money later on when you upgrade because you want to play the latest games and you bought a 6-core chip or only 16 gigs of RAM because it was "recommended," but the minimum and recommended specs for all games will rise, and it may be better to buy the higher-end part to avoid having to replace parts in the future because the PC is slowing down. ([This video explains it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnRjlsvJ3Y&t=517s))

Please visit [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), This is an excellent website for parting out your build. You can also send the list to friends and forums to get their feedback on your build. In addition, this website automatically checks to ensure that all of your parts are compatible, so you don't have to worry about whether something fits perfectly. ([How to use PCPartPicker to Plan Your PC Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NNjDwR1tME))

## Part Lists:

- [High end 2021 Build](http://youtube.com/watch?v=filG3hlN5Ok)
- [Overpowered Gaming PC Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0kx7hBeHc)
- [Ultra Airflow, Zero RGB - 1440p ITX Gaming Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUO59lwdB9I&t=95s) - This is my recommended PC; it is an all-around great build that will play anything, and it is small and quiet.
- [The ULTIMATE RTX 3060 Ti Gaming PC Build 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7CVBb0W4nI&t=181s) – this is a great midrange esports gaming PC for games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch, CS-GO, Rainbow 6, and Valorant.
- [The Herd Mentality PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mODI4-cRhPE&t=405s) - the case is a little unconventional, but this build has some of the best parts you can buy right now on Newegg. (all the parts come with warranties included with some parts having up to a 6-year warranty)
- [My STUNNING ITX RTX 3070 Gaming PC Build 2020!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3jx5LpgcZg&t=28s) – this is a really good small build; I really like the case. If you're looking for a small computer that will destroy everything you throw at it, this is it. I really think this is the perfect combo of parts right now: last-gen Ryzen paired with the new RTX 3000 gives one of the best gaming experiences out right now. For all this power to come in a console size is just the cherry on top.

## Active Deals!!!

- [PC Hardware Deals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCss3QxegBkF8BAetIo0qXA) – This channel continuously streams some of the best deals you can currently find on the market, as well as what is the best value for your money. If you're wondering which is better value for money, I'd recommend checking out their channel.
- I would also check out [dealsource.tech](https://www.dealsource.tech/deals-1) This website is updated daily with deals. They don't have as many PC hardware deals, but they do post a lot of storage deals. If you want good storage for a low price, this is the place to go. (_if you click a link and buy something it supports the people that make this website_)
- I would also check out Reddit, which has many threads on deals for PC hardware. My favorite is [r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/hot/) It's worth checking out because someone's always posting a deal. To find the most popular and legitimate deals, filter by hot or new.

- Good Prebuilds
  - New Egg is one of the largest online retailers in the United States for anything PC-related, and they have their own brand of PC called ABS, which is built with off-the-shelf parts and is reasonably priced. Dawid Does Tech recently reviewed [this ABS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APy_TyQSpPI) and found it to be adequate for the price. It ran a little hot due to the all-glass front panel, but he made a [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZhIpX97v0) for $50 to address the temperature issues. After adding some fans and replacing the CPU cooler this prebuilt can run E-sports games (Warzone, Apex legends, Fortnite, Overwatch, League of Legends, etc…) over 60fps.
  - If you have a Micro Center nearby, it is a great place to get help with your first PC. They offer pre-built computers from parts you select. [This video is a review of the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FEcewDnROg&t=245s)

## 1. Building

This step is not as difficult as it appears, but I recommend waiting until you have all of the parts before starting to build. [Carey Holzman](https://www.youtube.com/c/CareyHolzman/videos) is unquestionably the best YouTuber for computer building. He is the best at demonstrating where things go and explaining why he put them where they are. Please watch at least one of his build videos from start to finish before beginning to build the computer. Then, when putting it together, follow the video step-by-step.

- This build guide from Linus Tech Tips is also good. I would check it out if you have difficulty with 2 other build guides. _(By the way, this video is in POV, so it is easy to see what to do)_

- This build from Linus Tech Tips is a good [Beginner Build Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1t8YJvOWzo). In this video, he teaches an NBA player how to build his first computer.
- Here is a [beginners guide to gaming PC's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnHcRQUxuoeQM4-llcMNXTakKZcAAyB6) playlist. This will be another place to check when you come across something you may not know. _(These videos are optional)_
- I will also include some tip videos from other YouTubers that are helpful to know before you build.

  - [Fixing The Verge PC Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKzmYsySGFQ&t=983s) – This video provided a lot of helpful advice on topics that new builders often have questions about. It's a little different in that they're correcting the problems from another build guide that made a major controversy when a large tech news website posted a video on how to build a PC. This was such a bad guide from the Verge that lawyers got involved.

## 1. Optimizing Windows

***Please do not skip this step; it is so important.***

This is the most time-consuming and important step in ensuring that you get the most value for your money. I've helped friends who bought a 144Hz monitor but never went into the Nvidia control panel to change it from 60Hz to 144Hz, so they never used the 144Hz that they paid for. (Also, everything in this guide is not a virus even if your anti-virus detects it as a virus, it is not. I have checked every file with [Virus Total](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verKqNVshS4)).

**Watch as many of these videos as you can:**

- [Guide: What to do AFTER building your computer...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw)
- [A-Z 20H2 v2 Windows 10 Optimization Guide FPS BOOST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&t=228s)
- [How to Optimize Windows 10 For GAMING & Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkJBDEDDS5o&t=369s) – This video is 100% safe and will not cut into any of Windows' functionality. It will show you how to make sure Windows is ready to play the latest games.
- [Windows Apps the right way to remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6OT_QcHaU) – This is an easy video on removing all the bloat software that gets installed with Windows. It will speed up Windows and save you space.
- [How to REALLY make Windows 10 Super Light for Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU5F01oOzQQ&t=2s) – This is another video that shows how you can use scripts to make Windows light for gaming.
- [Windows 10 advanced optimization guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uQR_aBYxg&t=457s) - this guide will slightly cut into Windows functionality. I would recommend when he talks about Windows apps skip from 11:50 to 17:50; skipping this will still allow you to download apps from the Microsoft store. Also, for this video, I would skip disabling services with Nsudo that can cause problems down the road; the Overwatch A-Z video has a better way of disabling services. (Skip anything about Windows apps)
- [Overwatch | A-Z, Boost FPS & Optimization Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJrEQuylzOQ&t=228s) - even if you don't play Overwatch, this guide is still really good; it covers almost everything. I would recommend without cutting into Windows functionality at all, so please if you want to make Windows snappier for gaming and want a relatively short to the point tutorial this is it please watch this one. (Skip anything about Windows apps)

I really think that if you were to watch every video I provided in this guide, you should be more than capable of building and/or upgrading your own computer.
